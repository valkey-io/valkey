================================================================================
Valkey 7.2.4 RC1  -  Released Tue 09 Apr 2024 12:00:00 UTC
================================================================================

Upgrade urgency LOW: Initial release of Valkey with API compatibility for OSS
Redis 7.2.4. This release is based off of OSS Redis 7.2.4, with additional
functionailty to better brand the server as Valkey instead of Redis. All changes
are fully backwards compatible.

Changes to support Valkey branding
=========

* Rename the 6 Redis binaries to ones with `valkey` prefixes: `valkey-server`,
  `valkey-cli`, `valkey-benchmark`, `valkey-check-aof`, `valkey-check-rdb` and
  `valkey-sentinel`. (#62)
* During install, create symlinks mapping the corresponding Redis binary names
  to the new Valkey binaries. (#193)
* INFO fields: Introduce `valkey_version` and `server_name` fields. The
  `redis_version` will continue to be present and will indicate the Redis OSS
  version that the server is compatible with. (#47, #232)
* RDB file format: Introduce a `valkey-ver` RDB field to indicate an RDB file
  was produced by a Valkey server. This field is ignored when the file is
  loaded by Redis OSS. (#47)
* Module API changes: Introduce Valkey Module API in a new file, valkeymodule.h,
  with functions and types prefixed by ValkeyModule. Valkey is still fully ABI
  compatible with the Redis Module API, meaning Valkey supports running modules
  compiled with either the Redis or Valkey Module APIs. For full source
  compatibility, the Redis Module API (redismodule.h) is also kept with the
  RedisModule prefixed functions and types. (#194, #243)
* Scripting: Introduce a new top level `server` object for functions and scripts
  that replaces the existing `redis` object. This allows users to replace calls
  like `redis.call(...)` with `server.call(...)`. (#213)
* Makefile: Introduce `SERVER_CFLAGS` and `SERVER_LDFLAGS` as an alternative to
  `REDIS_CFLAGS` and `REDIS_LDFLAGS`. (#46)
* Update template config files to replace references to Redis with Valkey. The
  file valkey.conf replaces redis.conf. (#29, #171)
* Logging: Update startup and and shutdown logs to reference Valkey instead of
  Redis. Valkey server will also show the Valkey logo at startup (#251, #252)
