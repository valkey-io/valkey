/* Lookup a key for read or write operations, or return NULL if the key is not

 *
 * 1. A key gets expired if it reached it's TTL.
 * 2. The key's last access time is updated.
 * 3. The global keys hits/misses stats are updated (reported in INFO).

 * Flags change the behavior of this command:
 *
 *  LOOKUP_NONE (or zero): No special flags are passed.
 *  LOOKUP_NOTOUCH: Don't alter the last access time of the key.
 *  LOOKUP_NONOTIFY: Don't trigger keyspace event on key miss.
 *  LOOKUP_NOSTATS: Don't increment key hits/misses counters.
 *  LOOKUP_WRITE: Prepare the key for writing (delete expired keys even on
 *                replicas, use separate keyspace stats and events (TODO)).
 *  LOOKUP_NOEXPIRE: Perform expiration check, but avoid deleting the key,
 *                   so that we don't have to propagate the deletion.
 *
 * Note: this function also returns NULL if the key is logically expired but
 * still existing, in case this is a replica and the LOOKUP_WRITE is not set.

 * expired on replicas even if the primary is lagging expiring our key via DELs

 * behave like if the key is expired even if still present (because the

 *
 * In primary as a side effect of finding a key which is expired, such
 * key will be evicted from the database. Also this may trigger the
 * propagation of a DEL/UNLINK command in AOF / replication stream.
 *

 * it still returns KEY_EXPIRED if the key is logically expired. To force deletion
 * of logically expired keys even on replicas, use the EXPIRE_FORCE_DELETE_EXPIRED
 * flag. Note though that if the current client is executing
 * replicated commands from the primary, keys are never considered expired.
 *
 * On the other hand, if you just want expiration check, but need to avoid
 * the actual key deletion and propagation of the deletion, use the
